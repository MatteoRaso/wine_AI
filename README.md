## Analyse The Quality Of Red Wine With Machine Learning

To use, load in `wine_AI.pkl` and use the fit method, as described in
[the Sklearn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.score). Alternatively, you can use `AI.py` to train 
the AI from scratch, although several runs are typically needed to get
the best results. 

# Accuracy

The accuracy recorded for the AI stored in `wine_AI.pkl` is 72.5%.

# Dataset

The dataset for this AI was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
